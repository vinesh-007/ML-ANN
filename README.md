#Machine Learning Model Development
This project focuses on building and evaluating multiple machine learning models to analyze structured data and predict patterns. The models implemented include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow and Keras.

Key Aspects of This Project:
1. Data Preparation & Feature Engineering: Utilized Pandas for data cleaning, feature extraction, and train-test splitting to enhance the dataset's quality.
2. Model Implementation: Trained various supervised learning models and compared their predictive performance on the dataset.
3. Performance Evaluation: Assessed model accuracy and precision using Scikit-learn to determine their effectiveness.
4. GitHub Repository: Both the dataset and source code are uploaded to GitHub for further exploration and enhancement.

This project demonstrates expertise in data preprocessing, machine learning model development, and performance optimization, providing practical insights into predictive analytics.
